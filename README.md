# Frames By Percent

A mod that allows you to specify what FPS you wish to be on at what percentage of the level you are at.
Click the **%FPS** button in the pause menu to set the values. This is set on a per level basis.

Unlock FPS must be enabled in <cg>**Graphics Settings**</c> for this mod to work.

FPS Values <cr>below 60 FPS</c> will default to 60 FPS, this is a limitation of Geometry Dash, not this mod.
